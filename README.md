# PLINQO
Plinqo is a Pythonic implementation of C#'s LINQ functionalities. It aims to provide the same ease-of-use that LINQ does without deviating too greatly from Pythonic conventions.

This project is largely academic in nature, and is intended as a learning experience rather than a production utility.
